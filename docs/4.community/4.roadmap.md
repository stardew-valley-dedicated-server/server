## Release Cycle
We have no fixed release cycle, but we aim to follow [semver](https://semver.org/).

## Planned Features
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section is deprecated and should be processed.

These features are planned but pending, might be scrapped and still need a github issue and assignment to the roadmap:

- **[HIGH] Admin indicator**: Admins need a visible chat indicator to prevent name impersonation
- **[HIGH] Unit Tests**: Would be great to have least parts of the code base covered by automated (unit)-tests
- **[HIGH] Player list command**: Implement new /online command, showing player names with ping etc.
- **[MID] Backup integration**: Backups should be integrated into the server in a provider agnostic way
- **[MID] noVNC encryption**: Currently using insecure connections, but should use secure connections
- **[MID] noVNC password**: Prevent startup without VNC password, to prevent exposing by accident
- **[LOW] Runtime update checks**: Game and mod should check for updates while running
- **[LOW] Server tweaks**: Hide server from map, /list, chat, item pickup, visible in VNC etc.
- **[LOW] SMAPI CLI**: Allow to run commands in CLI, not only VNC
- **[LOW] Mod compiling**: Mod should be compiled inside a docker image instead of on host
- **[LOW] Display cabin owner**: Display cabin owner for everyone to see (for reference [see mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3036))
- **[LOW] Anticheat**: Haven't looked into it, but we want anticheat (for reference [see mod](https://github.com/funny-snek/anticheat-and-servercode)?)
- **[LOW] Discord integration**: WebHooks, Bot, something else?
- **[LOW] Server Plugins**: Plugin/mod system to extend the server (which we then also use internally)
- **[LOW] Custom launcher**: Custom app as a server browser with listing, favorites, per-server mod sync and more
- **[LOW] Performance Benchmarks**: Run benchmarks to get performance requirements
