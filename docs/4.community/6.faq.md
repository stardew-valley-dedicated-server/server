## Questions
### What is the project status?
JunimoServer is currently in an **unstable alpha release**, meaning itâ€™s actively under development, and not all features may work as expected. You may encounter [open bugs](https://github.com/stardew-valley-dedicated-server/server/issues) or incomplete functionalities. For updates and support, join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/w23GVXdSF7).

### What are the minimum hardware requirements?
JunimoServer is designed to run on modest hardware, but performance depends on player count and activity.

  - **CPU**: Dual-core processor (minimum)
  - **RAM**: 2 GB (minimum, though 4 GB+ is recommended for better performance)
  - **Disk Space**: 1 GB free (varies with save file sizes and logs)

For the best experience, we recommend a VPS or dedicated server with **at least 2 GB of RAM** and a stable internet connection.

### Can I run this on Windows or macOS?
Yes! While JunimoServer is optimized for Linux and runs best on Docker, it can also run on Windows or macOS systems that support Docker. For optimal performance and compatibility, a Linux environment is recommended.
