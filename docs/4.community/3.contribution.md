## How To Contribute
### Creating an Issue
#### Bug reports
Before submitting, please review our [guide for tips](2.reporting-bugs.md) on how to identify and report issues effectively.

#### Feature requests
Make sure there isn’t already an open issue or PR about the feature you’re proposing.

### Creating a Pull Request

#### Development Workflow
We use **GitHub Flow** with automated CI/CD. See the [CI/CD & Releases guide](8.ci-cd.md) for complete details.

**Quick workflow:**
1. Create feature branch from `master`: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature master`
2. Make changes and commit using conventional commits
3. Open PR targeting `master`
4. After merge, preview builds publish automatically

#### Commit Conventions
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages:

```
<type>: <description>
```

**Common types:**
- `feat:` - New feature (triggers minor version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fix (triggers patch version bump)
- `docs:` - Documentation changes only
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (dependencies, config)
- `refactor:` - Code changes without adding features or fixing bugs

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add cabin management system"
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak"
git commit -m "docs: update installation guide"
```

Note: `fix:` and `feat:` are for actual code changes. For typos or docs, use `docs:` or `chore:`.

#### Making the Pull Request
- PR title should follow [Commit Convention](#commit-conventions)
- Link related issues in the description
- Keep changes focused - one feature/fix per PR
- Avoid unrelated formatting or whitespace changes

We use "Squash and Merge" to combine commits when merging.
