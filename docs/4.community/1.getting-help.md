# Getting Help
If you encounter an issue and need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out! We're a welcoming and growing community and here to help.

## "I can't figure out how to (...)."
You’ve gone through the docs and checked existing issues for solutions, but it just doesn't want to work? The best thing to do is jump into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/w23GVXdSF7) and ask for help.

Don’t stress about asking something that feels obvious — we’ve all been there! ❤️

## "Help, is this a bug?"
We recommend taking a look at [how to report bugs](2.reporting-bugs.md). We're still in early development, so every issue helps to improve this project.
