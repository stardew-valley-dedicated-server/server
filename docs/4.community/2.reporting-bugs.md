# Reporting Bugs

## Is it a Bug or Something Else?
Before reporting, take a moment to consider whether you're encountering an actual bug or simply need help or clarification.

If you're unsure or just need assistance, it's often quicker and more effective to ask for help in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/w23GVXdSF7) community instead of filing a bug report.

## Search Before Reporting
Please check the [open issues](https://github.com/stardew-valley-dedicated-server/server/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.

If you find a similar issue, it's better to contribute to the discussion there by adding a comment, rather than creating a duplicate.

## Found a Solution but Unsure What to Do?
Don’t let standards and conventions intimidate you! While guidelines help maintain consistency, they're not strict rules.

Even if you're unfamiliar with development workflows, your input is highly valued. Feel free to share your solution or idea — we're here to help refine it together.
