# Installation

## Use Release
### Requirements
* Docker `>=20`

### Setup
1. **Create Configuration**

    Start by copying the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/stardew-valley-dedicated-server/server/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and [.env.example](https://github.com/stardew-valley-dedicated-server/server/blob/master/.env.example) files from the repository.

    Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and open the file to configure your server settings.

    Below is a minimal example configuration:
    ```sh
    # Steam Account Details (required for downloading the game server)
    STEAM_USER=""
    STEAM_PASS=""

    # VNC Server (for web-based administration access)
    VNC_PASSWORD=""
    ```

2. **Start the Server**

    To start the server as a background process using your configuration, run `docker compose up -d`.

    To see logs, run `docker compose logs -f`.


3. **Stop the Server**

    To save and stop the server, run `docker compose down`.

## Build Locally

* Docker `>=20`
* git `>=2`
* make `>=4`
* .NET SDK `6`

    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:stardew-valley-dedicated-server/server.git .
    ```

2. **Configure your IDE**
