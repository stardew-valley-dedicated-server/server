# Decompiling

## Why Decompile Stardew Valley?
In most cases, decompiling the game isn't necessary since Visual Studio can provide on-the-fly access to decompiled game code through its "Peek Definition" feature. However, if you need to explore the game logic in more detail or work on it within a separate project, decompiling can be useful.

## Decompile Stardew Valley
To decompile Stardew Valley run this script:
```sh
bash ./tools/decompile.sh
```
