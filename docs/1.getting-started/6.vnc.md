# Web VNC
To connect to the web VNC, open your browser and navigate to `http://IP:VNC_PORT`.

The settings panel on the left side can be used to set connection quality, compression level and scaling mode. The scaling mode `Remote Resizing` should not be used, it tends to break the server and requires a restart to be fixed.

Copy and paste only works via the settings panel clipboard area.
