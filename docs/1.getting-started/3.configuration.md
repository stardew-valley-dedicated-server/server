## Environment Variables
JunimoServer uses several environment variables for customization. When running the server with Docker, you can set these variables at runtime or during the build process.

### Runtime Variables
These variables are used during server operation, either at startup or throughout the server's lifecycle:
|Variable Name|Description|Default|Available in|
|---|---|---|---|
|GAME_PORT|Game Port|24643|1.0.0|
|DISABLE_RENDERING|Disables rendering in VNC|true|1.0.0|
|STEAM_USER|Required to download the game on initial startup or for updates, but not to run the server|-|1.0.0|
|STEAM_PASS|See STEAM_USER|-|1.0.0|
|VNC_PORT|Web VNC port|8090|1.0.0|
|VNC_PASSWORD|Web VNC password|-|1.0.0|

### Build Variables
These variables are only relevant during the build process:
|Variable Name|Description|Default|Available in|

|CI|Toggles between debug (`false`) and release (`true`) builds|false|1.0.0|
|CI_GAME_PATH|Must have value when `CI=true`|D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley|1.0.0|
