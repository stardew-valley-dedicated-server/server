# Usage
## Web VNC
To connect to the web VNC, open your browser and navigate to `http://IP:VNC_PORT`.

The settings panel on the left side can be used to set connection quality, compression level and scaling mode. The scaling mode `Remote Resizing` should not be used, it tends to break the server and requires a restart to be fixed.

Copy and paste only works via the settings panel clipboard area.

## Save Files
Save files are located in the `data` volume in the `Saves` directory.

Backup functionality is not built in yet, so make sure manually backup the `data` volume in regular intervals.
