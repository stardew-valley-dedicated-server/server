# Player Commands

Chat commands available to all players on a JunimoServer. Type in the chat box (press `T` or `/`). Commands start with `!`.

## General Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!help` | Show available commands |
| `!info` | Server info (farm, version, uptime, players, your ping) |
| `!invitecode` | Show invite code to share with friends |
| `!cabin` | Relocate your cabin to your right (must be on farm) |

Debris is cleared automatically when relocating.

## Password Protection

If the server requires a password:

```
!login serverpassword
```

After login, you'll warp to your cabin (new players) or last position (returning players).

## Admin Commands

These require admin privileges. See [Admin Commands](/admins/operations/commands#chat-commands) for the full list.

Commands are not case-sensitive.
