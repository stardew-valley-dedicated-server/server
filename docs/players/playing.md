# Gameplay Differences

## Differences from Regular Multiplayer

- **Always available** — The server is online 24/7, no need to wait for a host
- **Drop-in gameplay** — Join and leave whenever you want
- **Time pauses when empty** — Game pauses when no players are connected, resumes when someone joins

## Your Cabin

A cabin is automatically created when you first join. Use `!cabin` on the farm to relocate your cabin to your right.

## Saving

- Saves happen at the end of each in-game day
- Your inventory, skills, and relationships are preserved

## Crop Protection

Your crops won't die if you can't log in for a while. The server tracks crop ownership — unwatered crops get extra days instead of dying, and season-end death is delayed while you're offline. Normal rules apply once you return.

## Money

Servers can use shared (one pool for all) or separate wallets. Ask your admin which mode is active.

## Mods

Content mods (new items, NPCs, maps) require you to have matching mods installed. Ask your admin for the mod list.
