# Playing on the Server

What to expect when playing on a JunimoServer-hosted farm.

## Key Differences from Regular Multiplayer

- **Runs 24/7** — The farm keeps going even when no players are online
- **No host needed** — Join anytime without waiting for someone to host
- **Drop-in gameplay** — Join and leave whenever you want

::: tip Time doesn't pause
Unlike single-player, time keeps running when you open menus.

## Your Cabin

A cabin is automatically created when you first join. Use `!cabin` to move it to your current position.

## Time and Saving

- Time pauses when no players are online
- Saves happen at the end of each in-game day
- Your inventory, skills, and relationships are preserved

## Crop Protection

Your crops won't die if you can't log in for a while. The server tracks crop ownership — unwatered crops get extra days instead of dying, and season-end death is delayed while you're offline. Normal rules apply once you return.

## Money

Servers can use shared (one pool for all) or separate wallets. Ask your admin which mode is active.

## Mods

Content mods (new items, NPCs, maps) require you to have matching mods installed. Ask your admin for the mod list.

## Being a Good Farm Guest

- Communicate via in-game chat
- Respect others' cabins and resources
- Report bugs to the admin
