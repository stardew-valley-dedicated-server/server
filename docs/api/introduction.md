Just here for reference, but `OAOperationLink` components could be used to create pretty neat inline links, will leave this here to think about it for a bit.

For example I could tell you to <OAOperationLink href="/server/api/HandleGetStatus.html" method="get" title="fetch some data" /> in response to debugging steps or a tutorial, creating seamless transitions into the server API docs.
