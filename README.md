    Here is a minimal example configuration:

    ```sh
    # Steam Account Details (required for downloading the game server)
    STEAM_USER=""
    STEAM_PASS=""

    # VNC Server (for web-based administration access)
    VNC_PASSWORD=""
    ```

2. **Start the Server**:

    To start the server as a background process using your configuration, run `docker compose up -d`.

    To see logs, run `docker compose logs -f`.

3. **Stop the Server**:

    To save and stop the server, run `docker compose down`.
