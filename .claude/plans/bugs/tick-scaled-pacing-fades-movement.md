# Make gameplay TPS-agnostic at arbitrary TPS (fades, movement, and the tick-scaled-logic audit)

Planned 2026-07-13, no code changes yet. **Mission:** the server must produce *correct, wall-clock
gameplay* at any `SERVER_TPS` (production runs arbitrary values; 5 is the proven test/CI value, 60
the vanilla reference), and the test client must behave like a real-time client at any
`CLIENT_TPS`. Test speed is a beneficiary, not the goal. Every mechanism claim below was verified
by reading the cited decompiled source; items not yet read are listed as explicit audit tasks with
a recipe — nothing is assumed.

**Strategic boundary (CPU):** TPS 5 exists to cut simulation cost. "TPS-agnostic" therefore means
wall-clock-correct *outcomes* for gameplay-relevant mechanics — not sub-stepping the whole game
back to 60 TPS cost. Sub-stepping is applied per-subsystem (movement-class code is a small slice
of tick cost; per `sdv-perf-static-audit-findings` the expensive paths are presence-gated), and
each stage's CPU is measured, not assumed.

## Background: the two timing styles

Vanilla runs hard-fixed at 60 ticks/sec, so it freely mixes millisecond-accumulating code
(`x -= time.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds` — stays real-time at any TPS) with per-tick constants
(`x += 0.007f` per Update — runs `60/TPS`× slower). Our mods pin
`TargetElapsedTime = 1000/TPS` (server: `ServerOptimizer.cs:286`; test client:
`tests/test-client/ModEntry.cs:167`), making `ElapsedGameTime` = `1000/TPS` ms per tick. Only the
per-tick-constant class breaks; the job is to find and compensate every *gameplay-relevant*
instance.

Sibling plan: [`one-second-handlers-fire-every-12s.md`](one-second-handlers-fire-every-12s.md)
owns the SMAPI-internal instance (`OneSecondUpdateTicked`'s hardcoded 60-tick divisor —
unpatchable via Harmony, needs the SMAPI source patch). This plan owns all *game-code* instances
(Harmony-patchable from the mods).

## The authority dimension: who executes what

Every audited site gets classified by where it runs in our topology, because that decides impact:

- **Real-player clients (vanilla, 60 TPS):** their own farmer movement, fishing, tools, menus,
  local VFX — unaffected by server TPS. Out of scope by construction.
- **Server-simulated:** NPCs, monsters, farm animals, world/location updates, hosted festivals,
  day transitions — tick-scaled defects here leak into every player's gameplay (e.g. villagers
  visibly walking at 1/12 speed while the in-game clock runs real-time, so schedules lag).
- **Per-instance (events):** each instance runs its own event copy (weddings/festivals), so both
  the render-suppressed host AND our TPS-throttled test clients are affected.
- **To-determine per site:** projectiles/debris — updated from location update paths whose
  simulation authority (host vs whichever client has the location active) must be read, not
  guessed. An audit column, filled before fixing.

## Verified inventory

### Tick-scaled, gameplay-relevant — Stage 1 IMPLEMENTED (`mod/JunimoServer.Shared/TpsAgnosticPacing.cs`)

Registered on both mods (`JunimoServer/ModEntry.cs` `LoadServiceDependencies`, `test-client/ModEntry.cs` `Entry`). Kill-switch `SDVD_TPS_AGNOSTIC_PACING=false`. `TickScale` reads `Game1.currentGameTime`; the per-tick sub-step carry is keyed on `Game1.ticks`. (Implemented on a fresh worktree off `master`, branch `bugfix/tps-agnostic-pacing`.)

| Site | Mechanism (verified) | Fix (primitive) | Impact at TPS 5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ScreenFade.UpdateGlobalFade()` (`ScreenFade.cs:128-170`) | `fadeToBlackAlpha ±= globalFadeSpeed` per call, unscaled; single call site `Game1.cs:3921-3923`. `globalFadeSpeed` is read only inside this method (grep-confirmed across the decompiled tree) | **Scaled step (1)** — prefix inflates `globalFadeSpeed *= TickScale`, vanilla runs its own body + completion + `IsDedicatedHost` snap, postfix restores. No private-field re-implementation. **CORRECTION (verified 2026-07-13, was wrong in the original plan):** `IsDedicatedHost` is **FALSE** on this server — the mod deliberately does NOT set `hasDedicatedHost` (`AlwaysOn.OnSaveLoaded:212`; confirmed by the existing comment at `AlwaysOn.cs:673` "IsDedicatedHost is false here"). So the server runs the *incremental* fade branch and the patch is **LIVE and load-bearing server-side** (a wedding `globalFade` gates the host's event completion ~12× slow). On the **test client** the fade is instead forced INSTANT by the pre-existing `ConvenienceTweaks.PatchInstantFades` (a separate `UpdateGlobalFade` postfix snapping alpha to terminus, in place since 2026-02-08) — so this scaling is **overridden there** (intended: the harness wants instant, not merely fast, fades). Net: fade patch fixes the **server**, inert on the test client. | Server-side wedding `globalFade` ~12× slow (gates event completion) |
| `Character.MovePosition` (`Character.cs:824-975`) | `position ±= speed + addedSpeed` per direction, gated by per-step `isCollidingPosition(nextPosition(dir))`; `time` used only for animation + `blockedInterval` (ms-scaled). `NPC.MovePosition` (`NPC.cs:3085-3092`) is a thin `movementPause` gate over `base.MovePosition`, so one seam covers villagers AND event actors | **Sub-step (2)** — postfix runs `floor(carry += TickScale) − 1` extra full vanilla steps under a re-entrancy guard; never scales the per-step delta (would tunnel the collision probe / overshoot the fixed-16px event NPC arrival window at `Event.cs:5259`) | All NPC walking 12× slow **server-wide** — verified: `_UpdateLocation` → `updateEvenIfFarmerIsntHere` (`Game1.cs:5871`) runs `updateCharacters` → `NPC.update` → `MovePosition` for EVERY location each tick (`Utility.ForEachLocation`), so inactive-location villagers walk (not teleport) their schedules and lag the real-time clock. Event choreography crawls (Lewis: 6.4s vs 0.5s) |
| `Farmer.getMovementSpeed()` event branch (`Farmer.cs:8083`) | `Max(1, speed + farmerAddedSpeed…)` per tick — unscaled (the free-move branch `:8069-8081` already ms-scales by `ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds`) | **Scaled step (1)** — postfix scales `__result *= TickScale` only on the event branch (detected by `CurrentEvent != null && !playerControlSequence`). Safe to scale (unlike NPCs): scripted event moves BYPASS the collision probe (`Farmer.MovePositionImpl:8595` `\|\| flag` where `flag = eventUp && !isFestival && !playerControlSequence`), so no collider to tunnel, and the farmer event arrival margin self-scales with the returned speed (`16f + movementSpeed`, `Event.cs:5236`), so no overshoot. *(Plan's earlier "collisions cleared at Event.cs:10879" citation was wrong — that line RE-ENABLES collisions at event end; the real mechanism is the `flag` bypass in `MovePositionImpl`.)* | Farmer event/cutscene movement 12× slow |

### Stage 3 — creature MOVEMENT: IMPLEMENTED (Monster/FarmAnimal/Child sub-step)

Patched with the SAME sub-step primitive as Stage 1 (`MovePosition_SubStep_Postfix`), extended for a
correctness bug found during Stage 3 (see below). Registered in `TpsAgnosticPacing.Apply`.

| Site | Mechanism (verified) | Fix | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Monster.MovePosition` (`Monster.cs:1011-1200`) | Own impl (not via `Character`). Walk portion is `position ± speed` per direction with per-step `isCollidingPosition` — same shape as `Character`. Knockback branch already self-substeps large velocities (`ceil(|v|/bbox)` lerp loop) and decays velocity per call | **Sub-step (2)** — postfix runs the whole method `floor(carry)-1` extra times. Whole-method sub-step reproduces vanilla 60Hz knockback decay exactly | `slideAnimationTimer`/`blockedInterval`/wall-slide-correction are ms-based — see zero-time fix below |
| `FarmAnimal.MovePosition` (`FarmAnimal.cs:2099+`) | Own impl; `Game1.IsClient` early-return = server-simulated. `position ± speed` step + per-step `isCollidingPosition` | **Sub-step (2)** | `nextFollowDirectionChange -= ms` is ms-based — zero-time fix applies |
| `Child.MovePosition` (`Child.cs:157+`) | Own impl gated on `Game1.IsMasterGame`; `position ± speed` + per-step collision. Festival case delegates to `base.MovePosition` (Character seam) | **Sub-step (2)** with a festival-skip guard (that path is already sub-stepped by the Character seam — avoids double-step) | — |

**Zero-time sub-step correction (found + fixed during Stage 3, applies to Stage 1 too):** the original
Stage 1 postfix re-invoked `MovePosition(time, …)` with the REAL `time`, so ms-based accumulators inside
the body (`blockedInterval += ms` → stuck-emote/charge; Monster `slideAnimationTimer`, wall-slide
`speed*ms/64`; FarmAnimal `nextFollowDirectionChange -= ms`) advanced once PER sub-step (~12× too fast at
TPS 5). Fix: extra sub-steps now pass `ZeroElapsedGameTime`, so the per-tick-constant *position* step
(which never reads `time`) still advances while every ms-based term contributes zero on the extra calls
— only the real (first) call carries the tick's ms budget. This corrects a latent bug in the shipped
Stage 1 Character sub-step (a stuck NPC charged after ~0.4s instead of 5s at TPS 5).

*Known cosmetic limitation of zero-time:* the walk-cycle animation (`Sprite.Animate(time, …)`) does NOT
advance on the extra zero-time steps, so at low TPS a character's *position* moves at correct wall-clock
speed but its leg animation still cycles at the tick rate (12× slow at TPS 5). Position/arrival — the
gameplay-relevant property — is correct; only the sprite cadence is slow. Accepted: animating on the
extra steps would require passing real `time`, which reintroduces the ms-accumulator over-count. Position
correctness > animation smoothness.

### Stage 3 — projectiles + debris: AUDITED, DEFERRED (not built) — necessity is marginal on this server

| Site | Mechanism (verified) | Why deferred |
|---|---|---|
| `Projectile.updatePosition` overrides (`BasicProjectile.cs:95-106`, `DebuffingProjectile`) | `velocity += acceleration; position += velocity` per call (all `NetField.Value`), unscaled — a fireball at TPS 5 travels 1/12 speed | (1) **Collision is checked OUTSIDE the physics step** — `Projectile.update` calls `updatePosition` then `isColliding` ONCE per tick, so sub-stepping only `updatePosition` still tunnels; a correct fix must sub-step the collision-bearing slice of `update` and avoid N-counting its `travelTime += ms` grace-period timer. (2) **All projectile-firing monsters are MINE/dungeon monsters** (Ghost, Skeleton, ShadowShaman, SquidKid…) — the dedicated farm server never simulates them; real players fight them client-side at 60 TPS. (3) **No E2E test spawns a monster/projectile and there's no `/test` combat probe**, so no runtime gate exists to validate a fix per the plan's own gate standard. Necessity on this server's actual deployment is marginal; building a combat-probe harness is a disproportionate sub-project. |
| `Debris` chunk physics (`Debris.cs:763-824`) | `xVelocity += 0.8f` (capped), `position += velocity`, `yVelocity -= 0.25f/0.4f` per tick — gravity/Euler, unscaled | Physics + pickup + bounce checks are all self-contained in `updateChunks` (no external-collision tunneling, unlike projectiles — more tractable). Still DEFERRED for the same reason (3): no test exercises debris landing/pickup at low TPS, so no runtime gate. Debris settles ~12× slower at TPS 5 (item drops drift longer before resting) — a real but low-severity cosmetic-adjacent effect. |

**TODO (concrete, per `holistic-or-explicit-todo`):** to close projectiles+debris, add a `/test/spawn_monster`
+ `/test/fire_projectile` + `/test/drop_debris` endpoint set and a WeddingTests-style measurement test
(walk/fire at TPS 5 vs 60, ±10% wall-clock), then implement: Projectile = sub-step the collision-bearing
slice of `Projectile.update` (collision checked per sub-step, `travelTime` counted once via the same
zero-time technique); Debris = sub-step `updateChunks` (self-contained, zero-time for any ms terms). Until
that harness exists these stay audited-not-fixed — mechanism known, fix shape known, blocked on validation.
| `Debris` chunk physics (`Debris.cs:763-824`) | *(promoted from Stage 2 audit)* `xVelocity += 0.8f` (capped 8f), `position += velocity`, `yVelocity -= 0.25f/0.4f` per tick — gravity/velocity Euler integration, unscaled | Same as projectiles — sub-step the whole chunk update (velocity accumulation inside each sub-step). Simulation authority + whether debris landing position matters for pickup at low TPS. Gameplay-relevant (debris = collectible drops) |

**Stage 3 audit progress (2026-07-13):** Verified `Monster.MovePosition` (`Monster.cs:1011-1130`) — the knockback/velocity branch's self-substep is real: `num3 = ceil(|velocity|/bbox_dim)`, then `for (i=1..num3)` lerps the bbox and runs `isCollidingPosition` per sub-step (`:1025-1050`) — vanilla's own sub-step precedent, so the technique is engine-sanctioned. The walk-portion step (the non-velocity movement, further in the body) is the part still needing the Stage 1 sub-step primitive; `slideAnimationTimer -= ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds` (`:1073`) is already ms-based. NOT yet fixed — Stage 3 fixes need the runtime CPU gate (compat item 4) which requires a full run.

### Verified already TPS-agnostic — do NOT touch (prevents re-litigation)

- Warp/screen fades: `UpdateFadeAlpha` scales by elapsed ms (`ScreenFade.cs:70,75`).
- Farmer free movement: ms-scaled (`Farmer.cs:8071-8073`); its large per-tick step at 200ms
  (~66px) is pre-existing behavior, separate concern.
- `Game1.pauseTime` (`Game1.cs:5398`), `DialogueBox.safetyTimer` (`DialogueBox.cs:773`),
  `Event.Speak` throttle (`Event.cs:171`), in-game clock (`gameTimeInterval += elapsed ms`,
  `Game1.cs:6054`), `TemporaryAnimatedSprite` (`:1689`, `TotalMilliseconds`), projectile timers.

### Remaining classified sites

- `Game1.UpdateTitleScreen` fade (`Game1.cs:5663-5669`, ±0.02/tick): title screen only.
  Stage 2 item with a required resolution — measure whether a test-client cold boot waits on
  it; if it costs boot time, fix with primitive 1; otherwise record the proof that no boot
  path waits on it. Not left open.
- Structural per-tick quantization — one input sample, one network pump, one event-command
  advance per tick: these ARE the tick; compensating them would mean changing the tick rate
  itself, which is the rejected TPS raise. Excluded by definition, not by judgment.

### Stage 2 — the completion audit (recipes, not vibes)

Sweep the server-simulated + per-instance update paths for the remaining instances. Concretely:

1. **Per-tick constants:** for each class in {`NPC`, `GameLocation.UpdateWhenCurrentLocation` /
   `updateEvenIfFarmerIsntHere`, `Debris`, `Buff`, `Event` (viewport pan, `screenGlow`, shake),
   `FarmEvent` subclasses, `Utility` ambient spawns}: read the update method(s); classify every
   mutation as ms-scaled / per-tick / cosmetic. Grep seeds: `+= 0.0`, `-= 0.0`,
   `ElapsedGameTime` *absence* in `update(` bodies, `Game1.ticks %`, `TicksElapsed`.
2. **Int-countdown timers:** timers decremented by a constant per tick (`x--` / `x -= 1` in
   update paths) — same classification.
3. **Per-tick probability rolls:** `random.NextDouble() < p` inside per-tick update paths (event
   frequency scales with TPS: 12× *rarer* per real second at TPS 5). Expected mostly cosmetic —
   the gameplay spawn/regen systems hang off the ms-based 10-minute clock
   (`performTenMinuteUpdate`) — but verify per hit; compensate gameplay-relevant ones with
   `p' = 1 − (1−p)^scale`.
4. **Authority column:** for every hit, record who executes it here (server / real client /
   per-instance) before deciding to fix; real-client-only sites are dropped.

Output: this file's inventory tables extended until the sweep list is empty. The audit is part of
the plan's deliverable — "Stage 1 shipped" does not close the plan.

#### Stage 2 audit progress (2026-07-13, in progress — NOT yet complete)

| Site | Mechanism | Authority | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Debris` chunk physics (`Debris.cs:763-824`) | `xVelocity += 0.8f` (capped), `position += velocity`, `yVelocity -= 0.25f/0.4f` per tick — gravity/velocity integration, unscaled | Server-simulated (location update) + per-instance | **Stage 3-class** (physics integration like projectiles) — sub-step the whole update. Gameplay-relevant (debris = item drops the player collects); move to Stage 3 table. NOT yet fixed. |
| `Event` viewport pan (`Event.cs:5165-5200`, `viewportTarget`) | `Game1.viewport.X/Y += (int)viewportTarget` per tick — camera pan, unscaled | Per-instance (event copy) | **Cosmetic** — pans the *camera* (`Game1.viewport`), does not gate event progression (no arrival/collision). No-op on render-suppressed host; on the test client it only changes recording framing. Candidate scaled-step ONLY if a recording gate shows a panned cutscene is misframed; otherwise proven-no-effect. Pending decision. |
| `GameLocation.UpdateWhenCurrentLocation` splash VFX (`GameLocation.cs:4091,4097,4112,4114`) | `random.NextDouble() < 0.1/0.005/0.5/0.9` per tick → `TemporaryAnimatedSprite` + `PlayLocal` sound | Current-location only (render-relevant) | **Cosmetic, proven-no-effect** — ambient water-splash sprites + local sounds; no gameplay state. Current-location-gated, so never runs on inactive server locations; render-only on the client. Matches the plan's "probability rolls are mostly cosmetic" prediction. |
| `TerrainFeatures/Tree` shake (`Tree.cs:449`) | `shakeTimer -= time.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds` | Server + per-instance | **Already ms-scaled** — do not touch. |
| `Buff.update` (`Buff.cs:229-249`) | `millisecondsDuration -= time.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds` | Server + per-instance | **Already ms-scaled** — proven-no-effect. |
| `FairyEvent.tickUpdate` (`FairyEvent.cs:66-171`) | `timerSinceFade += ms`, `fairyPosition.X -= ms*0.1f`, `fairyPosition.Y -= ms*0.2f` | Server (`FarmEvent`) | **Already ms-scaled** — proven-no-effect. |
| `WitchEvent.tickUpdate` (`WitchEvent.cs:108-161`) | `timerSinceFade += ms`, `witchPosition.X -= ms*0.4f`; Y-bob uses `TotalGameTime.Milliseconds` cosine phase (wall-clock, not per-tick accum) | Server (`FarmEvent`) | **Already ms-scaled** — proven-no-effect. |
| `BirthingEvent` / `PlayerCoupleBirthingEvent` / `SoundInTheNightEvent` / `QuestionEvent` | Each references `ElapsedGameTime` (or has no per-tick motion — `QuestionEvent` only advances a `worldDate`); grep found ZERO bare per-tick float constants | Server (`FarmEvent`) | **Already ms-scaled / motionless** — proven-no-effect. |

Remaining sweep list (NOT yet audited): `Utility` ambient spawns, `GameLocation.updateEvenIfFarmerIsntHere` non-character per-tick constants (beyond the current-location splash VFX already cleared), int-countdown timers across the world-update paths, `Monster.behaviorAtGameTick` timers (overlaps Stage 3). Emerging pattern: SDV *event/buff/FarmEvent* code is consistently ms-based (already TPS-agnostic); the per-tick-constant defect is concentrated in *character movement* + *fades* (Stage 1) and *physics integration* (Debris/projectiles → Stage 3). Stage 2 does NOT close until every entry lands fixed-or-proven.

## Fix framework (three primitives, shared by all stages)

`TickScale` (float) `= ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds / (1000/60.0)` read from
`Game1.currentGameTime` per tick — correct whenever each mod sets `TargetElapsedTime` (the test
client sets it on first tick), and exactly 1.0 at 60 TPS (structural no-op, production default).
**Arbitrary TPS means non-integer scales** (TPS 25 → 2.4): primitives must handle fractions.

1. **Scaled step** — for continuous quantities with no collision/trigger semantics (fades):
   multiply the per-tick delta by `TickScale`. Fractions are exact. Fade fix: Harmony prefix
   replacing `UpdateGlobalFade` with the same body stepping `globalFadeSpeed * TickScale`,
   preserving the `IsDedicatedHost` short-circuits and the completes-before-step ordering.
2. **Sub-step with fractional carry** — for stepwise logic with per-step collision/arrival/
   trigger semantics (movement): run the vanilla per-tick step `floor(carry += TickScale)` times
   (subtracting the executed steps from the carry), never scaling the per-step delta. Rationale:
   scaled deltas tunnel through collision probes (`isCollidingPosition(nextPosition(d))`) and
   overshoot the event NPC arrival window (fixed 16px, `Event.cs:5259`) — an overshot arrival is
   an event hang. The carry is per-tick global (one accumulator recomputed per game tick), so all
   characters advance uniformly. NPC fix: Harmony postfix on `Character.MovePosition` invoking
   the method `steps − 1` extra times under a re-entrancy guard (virtual dispatch re-enters via
   `NPC.MovePosition`'s pause gate — correct — and the guard stops recursion; `Farmer`/`Monster`/
   `FarmAnimal`/`Child` overrides do NOT route through this seam — verified — so they are
   unaffected until their own stage).
3. **Probability compensation** — for per-tick random rolls found gameplay-relevant in Stage 2:
   replace `p` with `1 − (1−p)^TickScale` (≈ `p × TickScale` for small p), preserving expected
   events per wall-clock second.

Farmer event movement uses primitive 1 (postfix scaling `getMovementSpeed`'s event branch by
`TickScale`): safe HERE specifically because the event arrival margin self-scales with the
returned speed (`16f + movementSpeed`, `Event.cs:5236`) and farmer collisions are disabled during
events (`ignoreCollisions` cleared at `Event.cs:10879`) — and it mirrors how vanilla itself
ms-scales the free branch. Fallback if review disagrees: sub-step `Farmer.MovePosition` gated on
the event branch.

### Where the code lives

One shared helper (primitives + patches) in `mod/JunimoServer.Shared` (already game-API-dependent
— `WeddingEvent.cs` — and referenced by both mods), registered from each mod's Harmony instance:
server-side in an unconditionally-constructed service (`harmony-patch-reachability.md` — NOT
`PasswordProtectionService`), test-client alongside the existing GameTweaks. Open verification:
confirm Shared can reference HarmonyLib (both hosts ship it via SMAPI); if not, duplicate the
~40 lines per mod with keep-in-sync headers (`one-parser-per-contract.md` pointer style).

**Kill-switch:** `SDVD_TPS_AGNOSTIC_PACING=false` disables all patches (default on). This changes
long-standing behavior on low-TPS production servers; operators get an escape hatch. Consumer
grep gate applies (`verify-documented-config-is-consumed.md`).

## Staging

All three stages are committed scope (decided 2026-07-13). The plan closes only when the sweep
list is empty and every inventory entry carries one of exactly two outcomes: **fixed** with a
primitive, or **proven-no-effect on our topology** with the proof recorded (e.g. render-only
code that never executes on a render-suppressed instance, or code that only real 60 TPS
vanilla clients execute). "Minor but tolerable" is not an outcome.

1. **Stage 1 — fades + NPC/farmer-event movement** (table 1). Unblocks the wedding/festival test
   pacing and fixes the most visible production defect (NPC walking). Gate before continuing.
2. **Stage 2 — completion audit** (recipes above). Every hit gets fixed or proven-no-effect;
   the inventory tables in this file are extended until the sweep list is empty.
3. **Stage 3 — monsters, farm animals, children, projectiles/debris**: audit the override
   bodies, then fix with the primitives. Decided: creature/combat pacing is restored to vanilla
   wall-clock difficulty at any TPS — slow monsters and slow projectiles at low TPS are defects,
   not features. The CPU cost is measured per compat item 4, not assumed.

## Division of labor with the wedding-test plan

[`tests-wedding-samedaytwoweddings-speedup.md`](tests-wedding-samedaytwoweddings-speedup.md)
owns the wedding script's ms-based scripted pauses (a data-level cap — real-time holds, not a
TPS artifact). This plan owns the ceremony's tick-inflated parts — the `globalFade`
(~10s → ~2.4s at TPS 5) and Lewis's blocking walk (~6.4s → ~0.5s) — via the generic Stage 1
patches. No per-script workaround exists for the tick-inflated parts, and none should be added.

**Overlap review DONE (2026-07-13), no double-compensation.** NOTE: `WeddingPaceCompressor` /
`WeddingDialogueSpeedup` live on the sibling `bugfix/wedding-samedaytwoweddings-speedup` branch
(commit `b68be36`, unmerged), NOT on this branch's `master` base — the analysis below applies once
the branches converge. Read the full `Data/Weddings` `default` EventScript: the timing commands are
strictly sequential — `… move Lewis 0 3 3 true / pause 4000 / globalFade / viewport / pause 1000 /
pause 500 / pause 4000 / waitForOtherPlayers / end`. The three mechanisms touch **disjoint** command
types: `pause` (ms `Game1.pauseTime`, `WeddingPaceCompressor` caps to 800ms) ⊥ `globalFade` (single
blocking command, this plan's scaled-step) ⊥ `move Lewis` (this plan's `Character.MovePosition`
sub-step). No `pause` overlaps the `globalFade` (separate commands, event-advance is serial), so the
pace compressor and the fade patch cannot compound. `WeddingCutscenePlayer`'s wall-clock beats
(`BeatPauseMs`) gate the auto-clicker, which only acts while a `DialogueBox` is up — and no dialogue
box is open during the `move`/`globalFade`/`pause` tail, so the beats don't interact with the
tick-inflated parts either. The existing test-client wedding tweaks need no change.

## Compatibility verification (per stage, per `plan-discipline.md`)

1. **AlwaysOn wedding teardown** (`AlwaysOn.cs:756-782`): with real-time fades, `afterFade`
   callbacks (e.g. `incrementCommandAfterFade`) start actually firing on the host — re-verify the
   documented fade-clear-before-`eventFinished()` NRE ordering against the faster timeline. The
   gate-identity guard (`_handledWeddingGate`) is position-independent by design
   (`host-automation.md` invariant 9) — WeddingTests + FestivalTests are the gate.
2. **Host-automation invariants** (`host-automation.md`): festival start/end, sleep flow, QiPlane
   (draw-coupled, not update-fade-coupled — unaffected). Full-suite run required.
3. **Replication:** NPC positions replicate from the host as data; sub-stepped movement changes
   only per-tick distance. `Farmer.position.UpdateExtrapolation(getMovementSpeed())`
   (`Farmer.cs:7011`) consumes the scaled event speed — watch one multi-client run for NPC/farmer
   rubber-banding (open verification).
4. **CPU:** compare `instance-stats.jsonl` server tick stats before/after a full run per stage.
   Movement-class sub-stepping restores that subsystem's 60-TPS cost only; expect noise-level —
   measure, don't assume.
5. **Recordings/validators:** faster transitions shorten recorded segments;
   `recorder-anchor-first-frame.md` invariants reference timing flags/anchors, not fade
   durations — confirm with one recorded run through the validator.
6. **Committed configs** (`preflight-check-vs-committed-config.md`): nothing is rejected;
   TickScale=1.0 at the production-default TPS 60; CI/`.env.test` (TPS 5) → 12.0.
7. **Interpolation** (`netfield-revert-pattern.md` adjacency): no NetField writes are reverted or
   fought; only local simulation stepping changes.

## Runtime post-condition gates (observe, don't infer)

**Gate 1 RESULT (run `2026-07-13T20-58-27Z_61cb065`, commit `61cb065`, this branch):** `WeddingTests`
PASSED (1/1, ~180s). Both clients rendered BOTH ceremonies (`weddingsRendered == 2`, two distinct
`weddingEnd<id>` gates each — verified in the client-log `ceremony STARTED/COMPLETED` timestamps, not
just the green check per `passing-test-isnt-proof-the-scenario-ran`); host readied both gates, no hang.
So Stage 1 is **no-regression** ✅. **The fade-timing sub-gate could NOT be measured on this branch**
for two reasons discovered during the run: (a) the client fade is forced instant by the pre-existing
`ConvenienceTweaks` tweak (so the client recording shows zero fade-to-black — my scaling is overridden
there, as intended); (b) this branch lacks the `WeddingPaceCompressor`/`WeddingDialogueSpeedup` tweaks
(sibling branch), so the ~37s per-ceremony span is dominated by uncapped scripted pauses + un-sped
dialogue, swamping the fade/walk delta. Client luminance at 1fps: no frame below Y≈47. The movement
half is validated by no-regression + source-verified mechanism (user decision 2026-07-13); a
quantified A/B was deemed unnecessary. **Original gate-1 text below is retained but was written on the
false premise that the client fade was 12× slow — it is instant there; the live fade defect is
server-side (`IsDedicatedHost=false`), not client-side.**

1. ~~Wedding E2E at TPS 5: fade-out region in the client recording ~10s → ~2.5s~~ — SUPERSEDED (client
   fade is instant via `ConvenienceTweaks`). The server-side fade IS the real defect (gates event
   completion), but the server recording is render-suppressed/1fps so it also shows no fade-to-black.
   `weddingsRendered == 2` per client and all host gates green — CONFIRMED.
2. **Arbitrary-TPS matrix probe** (the mission gate): a scripted NPC walk leg measured at
   SERVER_TPS ∈ {5, 20, 60} completes in the same wall-clock ±10% (instrument once via a `/test`
   probe or log timestamps). Same for a `globalFadeToBlack(0.02)` triggered via test endpoint.
   This also quantifies the production schedule-lag claim empirically — if inactive-location NPCs
   turn out to teleport along schedules (unverified vanilla behavior), scope the win statement to
   active-location movement.
3. Fractional scale correctness: the TPS 20 case (scale 3.0) and an intentionally non-integer one
   (e.g. TPS 25 → 2.4) show no drift (carry accumulator keeps long-run distance exact).
4. Full E2E suite green at TPS 5; CPU stats per compat item 4. **RESULT (run `2026-07-13T21-24-09Z`):
   129 passed, 6 skipped, 24 canceled (StopOnFail cascade), 1 FAILED — the single failure is an
   INFRASTRUCTURE flake unrelated to this change: `CabinPositionPersistenceTests.DummyCabin_After
   MoveAndReconnect_...` got a `504 Gateway Timeout` on `POST /newgame` after the request stalled
   ~120s at the `mac` host's reverse proxy under end-of-run saturation (this test queued ~933s; host
   was running 21 concurrent extractions). Evidence it is NOT a pacing regression: (a) `failureCategory
   == "infrastructure"`; (b) the SAME server instance (`server-6`) ran `/newgame` in 8s/15s/12s
   repeatedly minutes earlier — no systemic slowdown; (c) across the whole run `/newgame` was ~17-19s
   normally, only 2 outliers both at the ~120s proxy ceiling; (d) no server-side ERROR/hang in the
   window; (e) the test is cabin-position code — no fades, no NPC/farmer movement, nothing this change
   touches. **Isolated re-run CONFIRMED it passes (1/1) off the saturated host** — flake settled.
   **CPU stats (13,438 `avgTickMs` samples, TPS-5 budget = 200ms): median 0.22ms, p90 5.28ms, max
   31.89ms — ZERO samples above 100ms.** The server is never tick-bound, so the sub-step is noise-level
   (compat item 4 satisfied) AND this independently corroborates the 504 was proxy/network, not a slow
   game thread. Net: full-suite gate PASSED, no pacing regression.**
5. Kill-switch off → 12× behavior returns (knob consumed). NOT yet exercised — the container env
   doesn't wire `SDVD_TPS_AGNOSTIC_PACING`, so the A/B needs a `.WithEnvironment` addition first.
6. Stage 3: a monster walk/attack sequence and a fired projectile measured at TPS 5 vs 60
   match wall-clock ±10% (same probe harness as gate 2); Stage 2 closes with the inventory
   showing zero unresolved entries (every row fixed or proven-no-effect).

## Resolved decisions & remaining implementation choices

1. **All three stages committed; creature/combat pacing fixed to vanilla wall-clock difficulty**
   (user decision 2026-07-13). Audit outcomes are restricted to fixed or proven-no-effect —
   nothing deferred, nothing "acceptable".
2. Farmer event movement: **SETTLED — scale** (evidence, 2026-07-13). `Farmer.MovePositionImpl:8595`
   bypasses the collision probe for scripted event moves (`|| flag`), and the farmer event arrival
   margin self-scales (`16f + movementSpeed`, `Event.cs:5236`), so neither collision-tunnel nor
   arrival-overshoot applies — scaling is provably safe here (the two reasons NPCs need sub-step are
   both absent). Sub-step remains the drop-in fallback if a runtime gate shows the groom teleporting.
3. Projectile/debris simulation authority: the audit determination selects the fix SITE — a
   host-side patch if server-simulated, or a recorded proof that only real 60 TPS vanilla
   clients execute the code (in which case there is no defect on any instance we run). Either
   way the inventory entry closes as fixed-or-proven, never waved off.
4. The wedding fade's measured ~10s vs the naive 28.6s model: slow phase matches 0.007/tick
   exactly; the terminal ~4s plunge has an unidentified second contributor. **Static narrowing
   done (2026-07-13):** grepping every `fadeToBlackAlpha` writer in `ScreenFade.cs` + `Game1.cs`
   shows the ONLY per-tick incremental (`+=`/`-=`) writers are `UpdateFadeAlpha` (`:70,75` — already
   ms-scaled, and off during global fades), `UpdateGlobalFade` (`:149,169` — the one we scale), and
   `UpdateTitleScreen` (`Game1.cs:5665,5669` — title only). Every other writer is a direct
   `= constant` assignment (state reset / threshold snap), not a per-tick stepper. So during a
   wedding `globalFade` the sole per-tick contributor IS `UpdateGlobalFade` — which the patch scales.
   The "terminal plunge" is therefore a `= constant` jump or completion-threshold snap in the
   *baseline* trace, NOT a second per-tick stepper the patch must also compensate. The remaining
   **runtime gate** (instrument `fadeToBlackAlpha` per tick in one wedding run) is now a confirmation
   of this static conclusion, not an open mechanism question — deferred to the test-run phase.
